Toaster
=======

Toaster is a simple static blog generator. The goal, with Toaster, is to mimic the functionality and usage of Jekyll. So why Toaster, then? It's written in Python and feels more lightweight than Hyde, which seems to be the current Python alternative to Jekyll.

Getting Started
===============

Toaster can be installed from pypi using pip. Invoke Toaster using the "toast" command.

Runtime Dependencies
====================

* PyYAML: YAML parser and emitter for Python
* Markdown: Python implementation of Markdown
* Jinja2: A small but fast and easy to use stand-alone template engine written in pure python
